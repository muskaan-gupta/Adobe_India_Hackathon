The concept of autonomy in second/foreign language learning and teaching has been,9.48,0,0,0,left,85.1,1,81,0,body
the focus of attention for many researchers and practitioners for more than three,9.48,0,0,0,left,85.1,1,81,0,body
"decades. According to Benson (2001), the notion of autonomy was introduced and",9.48,0,0,0,left,85.1,1,78,0,body
popularized in 1981 by Henri Holec in his seminal report for the Council of Europe,9.48,0,0,0,left,85.1,1,82,0,body

Autonomy in Foreign Language Learning,9.48,0,1,0,left,124.34,1,37,0,body
in which the researcher defined,9.48,0,0,0,center,337.15,1,31,0,body
autonomy in the context of language learning as “the ability to take charge of one’s own,9.48,0,0,0,left,85.1,1,88,0,body
"learning” (Holec, 1981, p. 3). Holec’s idea of autonomy encompasses some components",9.48,0,0,0,left,85.1,1,83,0,body
and capacities on the part of language learners (e.g. self-directed learning). For some,9.48,0,0,0,left,85.1,1,87,0,body
"other authors autonomy also involves “a capacity – for detachment, critical reflection,",9.48,0,0,0,left,85.1,1,87,0,body
"decision-making, and independent action” (Little, 1991, p. 4) and “the capacity to take",9.48,0,0,0,left,85.1,1,87,0,body
"control of one’s own learning” (Benson, 2001, p. 46). As stated by Benson (2011, p.",9.48,0,0,0,left,85.1,1,83,0,body
"16), “autonomy is multidimensional and takes many different forms according to the",9.48,0,0,0,left,85.1,1,82,0,body

"roots are based in political, societal and educational developments. In addition to this,",9.48,0,0,0,left,85.1,1,89,0,body
work on autonomy emphasizes social dimensions of learner autonomy in view of the,9.48,0,0,0,left,85.1,1,80,0,body
"fact that “autonomous learners always do things for themselves, but they may or may",9.48,0,0,0,left,85.1,1,83,0,body
"not do things on their own” (Little, 2009, p. 223) and that by means of social",9.48,0,0,0,left,85.1,1,78,0,body
"interactions language learners “develop a capacity to analyze, reflect upon and",9.48,0,0,0,left,85.1,1,79,0,body
"synthesize information to create new perspectives” (Lee, 2011, p. 88). It should also be",9.48,0,0,0,left,85.1,1,88,0,body
noted that recent research shows that fostering autonomy is no longer predominantly a,9.48,0,0,0,left,85.1,1,85,0,body
matter of individualizing learning through out-of-class initiatives since the dominance of,9.48,0,0,0,left,85.1,1,90,0,body
"classroom-based approaches (Benson, 2011). Finally, it has to be added that",9.48,0,0,0,left,85.1,1,75,0,body
"researchers, in general, seem to be in agreement with the following claims suggested",9.48,0,0,0,left,85.1,1,84,0,body
by Benson (2011): “(a) language learners naturally tend to take control of their,9.48,0,0,0,left,85.1,1,80,0,body
"learning, (b) learners who lack autonomy are capable of developing it, and (c)",9.48,0,0,0,left,85.1,1,78,0,body
autonomous language learning is more effective than non-autonomous language,9.48,0,0,0,left,85.1,1,75,0,body
learning” (p. 16).,9.48,0,0,0,left,85.1,1,18,0,body
Perhaps in order to define the concept of autonomy in language learning it is necessary,9.48,0,0,0,left,85.1,1,87,0,body
"to understand who autonomous learners are. As Littlewood (1996) claims, an",9.48,0,0,0,left,85.1,1,74,0,body
autonomous learner is “one who has independent capacity to make and carry out,9.48,0,0,0,left,85.1,1,77,0,body
choices which govern his or her actions” (p. 428). The researcher argues that this,9.48,0,0,0,left,85.1,1,82,0,body
"capacity depends on two major components such as ability and willingness, and he",9.48,0,0,0,left,85.1,1,80,0,body
"claims that the attributes can also be further subdivided. Thus, ability depends on",9.48,0,0,0,left,85.1,1,83,0,body
having knowledge about the options from which one can choose and skills so as to,9.48,0,0,0,left,85.1,1,80,0,body
"choose the most suitable alternatives. When it comes to willingness, this depends on",9.48,0,0,0,left,85.1,1,84,0,body
having motivation and confidence in order to take responsibility for adequate choices.,9.48,0,0,0,left,85.1,1,86,0,body
"Moreover, Littlewood (1996) argues that if an individual is to be successful in being",9.48,0,0,0,left,85.1,1,85,0,body
"autonomous, all of these components have to be present all together.",9.48,0,0,0,left,85.1,1,68,0,body
"At the close of this section, a few words are in order on the notion of autonomous",9.48,0,0,0,left,85.1,1,82,0,body
language learning. An interesting description of the concept in question is offered by,9.48,0,0,0,left,85.1,1,86,0,body
"Reinders (2011), who defines autonomous language learning as “an act of learning",9.48,0,0,0,left,85.1,1,80,0,body
whereby motivated learners consciously make informed decisions about that learning”,9.48,0,0,0,left,85.1,1,83,0,body
"(p. 48). According to the said researcher, it is not possible or needed in all acts of",9.48,0,0,0,left,85.1,1,86,0,body
learning to be able or ready to intentionally make decisions since different learning,9.48,0,0,0,left,85.1,1,85,0,body
situations present different demands. Reinders (2011) further argues that “autonomy is,9.48,0,0,0,left,85.1,1,86,0,body
"not an either-or concept, but has to be seen as a continuum” (p. 48). This is because a",9.48,0,0,0,left,85.1,1,87,0,body
